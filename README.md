# Rock League Logger Microservice
### Leo Belyi

Essentially this is the microservice that allows you to store your climbing journal content.
Decided it was best to do it as a microservice largely because the Log content could probably
get pretty big and a Document-based DB just seemed right given how isolated the data modeling is.
